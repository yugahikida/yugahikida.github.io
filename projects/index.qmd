The paper suggests the method to visualize 4D compositional data on a 2D canvas. My contribution is general polishing of manuscript, creating 3D interactive figures and animation, and development of R package (planned).

## R package "metabmc"

The package implements meta-uncertainty quantification of posterior model probabilities
for Bayesian models. Check [the project website](https://meta-uncertainty.github.io) for more detail. The development is still in progress and will be published in near future.

## R package for Bayesian proxy structural VAR

The package implements Bayesian vector autoregressive regression model with proxy
variables for structural shocks in economy. The development is still in progress 
and will be published in near future.
