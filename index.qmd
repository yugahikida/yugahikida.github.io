::: {#about-block}
From 2025, I will be a  doctoral researcher in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) 
at Aalto University, working on compute-efficient and robust 
simulation-based inference with [Ayush Bharti](https://bharti-ayush.github.io/).

Prior to that, I was a master student in Econometrics at TU Dortmund University, 
where I worked as a research assistant on the development of R packages for 
Bayesian model comparison (with [Marvin Schmitt](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/)) 
and Bayesian vector autoregression (with [Jan Prüser](https://sites.google.com/view/janprueser/welcome)),
and wrote thesis on amortized Bayesian experimental design under the supervision of Marvin Schmitt,
[Desi Ivanova](https://desirivanova.com/), and [Paul Bürkner](https://paulbuerkner.com/).
